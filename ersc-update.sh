# Elden Ring Seamless Co-op Updater for Linux
#
# Description:
# This script automates updating the "Elden Ring Seamless Co-op" mod on Linux.
# It automatically finds the latest release from GitHub, downloads it, detects
# the Elden Ring installation path (for both standard and Flatpak Steam),
# backs up existing mod settings, and installs the new files.
#
# Author: youp211
# Version: 2.0
# ==============================================================================
