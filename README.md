Run this script and you will not have to change steam options. Just run the game as normal and it will automatically run the elden ring seamless coop mod. If you wish to restore your game. Just run the built in steam integrity check to restore the games original executable file. Alternatively it will be in your game folder named start_protected_game.exe.backup. You can rename this back to the original exe file name start_protected_game.exe and your game will be restored.
