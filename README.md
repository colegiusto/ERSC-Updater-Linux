To set the script as executable:


** Terminal Emulator **


Use chmod +x ./ersc-update.sh from the folder you have downloaded the script to.


** Desktop Environment GUI **


Note: The exact steps and terminology may vary slightly depending on your specific desktop environment (e.g., GNOME, KDE, MATE).

Example (GNOME):

Open the "Files" app.

Navigate to the script's location.

Right-click on the script and select "Properties."

Go to the "Permissions" tab.

Check the "Allow executing file as a program" box.

Click "Close."


** Other Notes **


You do not need to run the script as root unless you have changed permissions on your TMP directory or your home directory. Try to run the script as non root first as a best practice.

Run this script and you will not have to change steam options. Just run the game as normal and it will automatically run the elden ring seamless coop mod. If you wish to restore your game. Just run the built in steam integrity check to restore the games original executable file. Alternatively it will be in your game folder named start_protected_game.exe.backup. You can rename this back to the original exe file name start_protected_game.exe and your game will be restored.
